# Recipe Storage

The goal of this project is to help people use their food
storage more efficiently by helping them sort it and encouraging
them to use items before they expire.

Realistically, it can take a few hours to record the food you already
own, so it's difficult to get started, but after that, if you just
add items whenever you shop, and delete them when you use them,
it's not so bad.

Currently there are 3 main parts of the program.

## 1. Add Food Storage Items

Here you can scan an items barcode, set the expiration,
and fill in any other missing details when you get new food items.

## 2. View Food Storage

Here you can see a list of the food you own, sorted by their expiration
dates. If you want to know more details about an item, you can click on
it and see more.

## 3. View Food Storage Addition and Deletion History.

Here you can see what items you have added and deleted recently.
This is helpful for when you forget whether you have already done
something and want to make sure you don't do it an extra time.

## Coming Soon

### Search for recipes based on items you own.

This will help users find a way to use items that
are going to expire soon without letting them go to
waste.
