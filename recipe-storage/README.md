# Recipe Storage

Welcome to Recipe Storage.

TA, you can find where I use fetch to get data from an external API in src/components/ViewRecipes.js,
and src/components/ItemFetcher.js. For the purposes of this creative project, you can just look at the
first one. It looks better than the second one. The second one is a cool concept because I use the camera,
but it doesn't work with a lot of barcodes. Creamy peanut butter is easy to get to work. Anyway, I hope
you enjoy looking around the website, especially the recipes tab.
